# WIR Project

This is the project for the **Web Information Retrieval** course at La Sapienza University of Rome.

## Goal
The project is inspired by the following [paper](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/E09-3009). 
What we do is create a new similarity metric to measure the **semantic similarity** between documents.
We use WordNet  in order to do measure similarities between two terms.
